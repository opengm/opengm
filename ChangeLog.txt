** OpenGM 2.1 (XX.XX.XXX)
**
** Developers in charge: 
**  * Thorsten Beier       ( thorsten.beier[AT]iwr[DOT]uni-heidelberg[DOT]de )
**  * Joerg Hendrik Kappes ( kappes[AT]math[DOT]uni-heidelberg[DOT]de )
****************************************************************************************************
* Since the release of 2.0.2 some time has gone we have fixed several bugs and add new functionality.
* OpenGM has been used for a computer vision benchmark, which has profit from the high flexibility of
* OpenGM. 
*****

* bug-fixes in DualDecomposition
* bug-fixes in Alpha-beta-swap (stopping condition)
* bug-fixes for several functions ( e.g. sparsefunction)
* bug-fixes for Gibbs
* bug-fixes for code using external libraries 
* several small bugfixes
* CMake cleanup
* add support for maximizing models with LPCPLEX
* add compiler-warning-level-option to cmake
* add method to get the function corresponding to a factor
* add method to get internalIDs to add additional constraints to LPCPLEX 

* generalize the caller interface -> all callers need to be a bit modified
* add python interface (beta-state)
* add new matlab interface (beta-state)
* add some modelconverters e.g. opengm2uai


* New inference Methods
 - MQPBO
 - Reduced Inference
 - Alpha-Expansion-Fusion (using the reduction code of Alexander Fix)
 - InfAndFlip (Meta-solver) 
* new wrappers for external libs
 - FastPD
 - GCO-Lib

** OpenGM 2.0.2 beta (01.06.2012)
**
** Developers in charge: 
**  * Bjoern Andres        ( bjoern[AT]andres[DOT]sc )
**  * Thorsten Beier       ( thorsten.beier[AT]iwr[DOT]uni-heidelberg[DOT]de )

****************************************************************************************************
* We realize, that having just tables available to store/represent functions, which was sufficient for 
* our problems at this time, is not sufficient for many large scale problems. The fact that i) many 
* factors map the same function to different variables and ii) functions can often be represented much
* more memory efficient. This ends up in the extended factor graph framework which includes functions 
* as another set of nodes in the graph and allows factors to share functions. Furthermore, opengm-model 
* can now deal with different types of functions.
* As a consequence OpenGM2 is not compatible with OpenGM1
*****

* Change to from BSD to MIT licence 
* put project on github
* reorganize project structure
* Extend factor graph models by a set of function(-nodes)
* add several type of functions 
* introduce more template parameters to the model
 - ValueType type used for objective function
 - IndexType type used to index variables and factors 
 - LabelType type used for state-/label-space
* add different space types
* re-implement the model-decomposition
* model-generator and blackbox-test-framework for inference-unit-tests
   
* add inference algorithms
 - dualdecomposition with subgradient and bundle methods
 - alpha-expansion
 - alpha-beta-swap
 - dynamic programming
 - ILP and LP-relaxation solvers (using CPLEX)
 - LOC
 - QPBO
 - 2SAT-solver
 - gibbs-sampler
 - swendsenwang algorithm
* add wrappers to external inference libraries
 - extern/MRF-LIB
 - extern/QPBO
 - extern/TRWS
 - extern/LibDAI
 - provide wrappers for fast external maxflow code (IBFS, Kolmogorov's MaxFlow)
* redesign LBP and TRBP 
* redesign the visitor concept for code injection
* implement our own command-line tool

****************************************************************************************************
* Initial release as a merge of two independent projects by Bjoern Andres and Joerg Hendrik Kappes. 
*****

* discrete factor graph models over various semi-rings which can be exchanged by templates
* factors only support explicit functions (tables) but can depend from more than 2 variables
* inference algorithms
 - AStar
 - LBP
 - TRBP
 - GraphCut (using boost/max-flow)
 - ICM
 - LazzyFlipper
* command-line interface with tclap
* file i/o which allows to save models into HDF5 files
* primitive matlab interface
* cmake build scripts
