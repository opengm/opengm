Introduction
-----------------
`OpenGM <http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/opengm2/>`_  is a C++ template library for discrete factor graph models and distributive operations on these models. 
OpenGM Python exports the functionality of the C++ library OpenGM to Python. 
It includes state-of-the-art optimization and inference algorithms beyond message passing. 
OpenGM handles large models efficiently, since  functions that occur repeatedly need to be stored only once .
No restrictions are imposed on the factor graph or the operations of the model. 
The graphical model data structure, inference algorithms and different encodings of functions interoperate through well-defined interfaces. 
The binary OpenGM file format is based on the HDF5 standard and incorporates user extensions automatically.
